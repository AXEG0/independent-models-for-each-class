## What:
Jupyter notebook:
- Create a synthetic dataset
- Split the data into training and test
- Function for training and evaluating classifiers
- Look at the models
- Predict both classes using the "a" model
- Split dataframe with prediction of model a
- Calculate the overall accuracy of the two models
- Define class in order prediction function and let the model "b" work with class 0
- Swap models
- Compare the result with the work of Hard Voting ensemble
- Soft voting result
